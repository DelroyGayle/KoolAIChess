        Black at the top has negative values
        You have: The value of each piece followed by its letter
        Zero and Space show the empty squares
        Then White at the bottom has positive values

        I chose not to use a 8X8 array with numerical indices

        In the Chess World,
        A chess board is depicted as eight ranks (rows) numbered
        from the bottom of the board 1 to 8
        Files are columns that are labelled left to right with numbers
        So a chessboard is depicted as
        a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, h8
        a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7
                    ...
                    ...
                    ...
                    ...
                    ...
                    ...
        a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2
        a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1

        Therefore I chose to use a dictionary to reflect the above scheme
        The keys being a string e.g. 'h8' for the square h8
        Then each value would be a Piece Class instance variable
        of the form (PIECE VALUE, LETTER, SIGN)
        Therefore the Dictionary would look like this
        {a8:value, b8:value, ... a1:value, ... h1:value}
        Blank squares will have the value None
