Kool AI Chess - A Chess program written in Python - User vs Computer

For my Code Institute Portfolio Project 3, 
I would like to implement a Chess Program in Python.

In my search for a suitable algorithm I came across this [476-line BASIC PROGRAM by DEAN MENEZES](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/express/issue23/Tut_QB_Chess.txt)

Let me reiterate: the basis of my project is a Chess Program written in **BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)**
available [here](http://www.petesqbsite.com/sections/express/issue23/Tut_QB_Chess.txt)

I found it amazing how Mr Denezes has written such an highly interesting chess playing program in under 500 lines.
My goal then is to convert it to Python and add ***castling and en passant*** chess moves to it so that the user can play a complete game of Chess against their Computer opponent, namely, ***Kool A.I.***

## UX

### Design

#### Logic Flow of the program

#### A Mock-up of how the game will look like

The game begins with this view

If for example, the user plays **e2e4**

Then the computer may respond with **e7e5**

## Credits/Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge Don Menezes, the author of the BASIC program on which my project is based.
I would like to acknowledge Rod Bird who also adopted Menezes' code. I preferred Bird's display of the Chess Board.
